        "A 1/4: Many people find that modern TVs often have a big problem: they break down too easily. This means they stop working or have issues, even though they're not very old. One reason for this is that companies sometimes use cheaper materials to make TVs, so they don't last as long. Another reason is that new models come out so fast, making older TVs seem outdated sooner. Plus, modern TVs are more complicated with lots of features, which can lead to more things going wrong. While some say this helps the economy by making people buy new TVs more often, it creates more electronic waste, hurting the environment. To fix this, TV companies should focus on making TVs that last longer and are easier to repair. People can also help by choosing TVs wisely and pushing for more sustainable practices in the electronics industry. That way, we can reduce the problem of modern TVs breaking down too easily.",
        "A 2/4: Young children accidentally breaking expensive TVs is a common worry for many families. Their natural curiosity and developing motor skills can lead to unintended accidents, like bumping into or knocking over the TV while playing. Because kids may not fully understand the value or fragility of electronic devices, they might handle them carelessly. Parents can take steps to prevent such mishaps by installing TV mounts or placing the TV out of reach of children. Teaching kids about treating electronics with care and setting clear rules about TV use can also help minimize accidents. While it's frustrating when expensive TVs get broken, accidents happen, especially with young children. By taking precautions and teaching responsible behavior, parents can reduce the risk of damage to expensive electronics and create a safer environment for their children to play and learn in.",
